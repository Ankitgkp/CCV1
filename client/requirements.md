## Packages

lucide-react | Beautiful icons for the UI

## Notes
Tailwind Config - extend fontFamily:
fontFamily: {
  sans: ["'DM Sans'", "sans-serif"],
  display: ["'Outfit'", "sans-serif"],
}
Mobile-first design approach is critical.
Map placeholder will be a static div as requested.
Mock data will be used where backend endpoints might not be fully populated yet (though hooks are wired to API).
